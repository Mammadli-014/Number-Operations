 Numbers Utility

A Java program that performs common number-related operations such as calculating factorials, finding prime factors, greatest common divisors (GCD), and least common multiples (LCM).

* Features:

• Factorial Calculation: Recursively calculates the factorial of a given number.
• Prime Numbers: Automatically generates a list of prime numbers up to 100.
• Prime Factorization: Finds the prime factors of a given number.
• GCD (Greatest Common Divisor): Calculates the GCD of two numbers using their prime factors.
• LCM (Least Common Multiple): Calculates the LCM of two numbers based on their GCD.

This file summarizes the functionality of the program in a clear and concise manner.
